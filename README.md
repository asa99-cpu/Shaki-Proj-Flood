# Real-Time Flood Risk Map for Kurdistan

## Project Description
This project aims to create a **real-time flood risk map** for Kurdistan or a specific city in Kurdistan. The map will visually display areas at risk of flooding (marked in red) and safe zones (marked in green) based on **real-time rainfall predictions** and **historical rainfall data**. By combining these datasets, the tool will provide accurate and actionable insights to help communities prepare for potential floods.

The target problem is the lack of accessible, real-time flood risk information, which often leads to delayed responses and increased damage during heavy rainfall. This project will save time for emergency responders, improve disaster preparedness, and ultimately reduce the impact of floods on communities. It will also empower citizens to make informed decisions about their safety.

## Core Features and Functionality
The core features of the project include:
1. **Real-Time Flood Risk Map**:  
   - Displays flood risks for the next day using real-time rainfall prediction data.  
   - Highlights high-risk areas in red and safe zones in green.  

2. **Historical Flood Risk Map**:  
   - Shows flood risks based on historical rainfall data to identify patterns and vulnerable areas.  

3. **Data Integration**:  
   - Combines historical rainfall data with real-time predictions to improve accuracy.  
   - Uses datasets from reliable sources (e.g., meteorological websites).  

4. **Simple Visualization**:  
   - Uses tools like **Streamlit** or **Folium** to create interactive maps.  
   - Focuses on functionality first (e.g., displaying data with `st.write()` or `st.map()`).  

## Ethical Alignment
This project aligns with **ethical standards** by prioritizing community safety and providing transparent, accessible information. It supports **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, particularly:
- **SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)**: By reducing the impact of disasters on urban areas.  
- **SDG 13 (Climate Action)**: By helping communities adapt to climate-related risks like flooding.  

The project ensures data privacy and promotes equitable access to critical information, empowering all citizens to protect themselves and their property.
